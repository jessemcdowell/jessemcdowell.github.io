      <description>Unit tests are undeniably a good thing, but you only realize the full benefits of them when you have enough tests that you can make changes with confidence. If you can make a change, run your tests, and be comfortable enough to ship your changes, then you and your team can get work done much faster. More drastic changes to the shared code become feasible. Life gets better.&#xA;It makes sense then that teams want to ensure that code is sufficiently covered with tests.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m charging forward on the Shared Resource Schedule Service. There are a lot of things I&amp;rsquo;m getting into place before I start writing code. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to tell me that I&amp;rsquo;m not being agile either, you always need to design a little to write good code. The key to being agile is designing only as much as you need, and being prepared to change your mind later.&#xA;The Name The first order of business was to choose a name.</description>
