      <description>There are few things more refreshing than a cold glass of good iced tea. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried iced tea from a lot of places, but the best I&amp;rsquo;ve had to this day is my own recipe. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy that I can&amp;rsquo;t in good conscience keep it secret. It&amp;rsquo;s also far cheaper than anything you can buy in a can or bottle, and a lot healthier because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any kind of sweetener.</description>

      <description>When I was a child, I drank tea because my parents wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me drink coffee. I would soak a tea bag in hot water until it made a dark, bitter liquid, then dump in milk and sugar until it was overly sweet, and mostly flavourless. I would sip it to fit in with adults, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that it was something I enjoyed.&#xA;As a young adult, I tried loose tea on the advice of a friend.</description>
