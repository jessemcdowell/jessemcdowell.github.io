      <description>Back in September Google announced that Google Podcasts will be shut down. It is supposed to remain available until April of 2024 and be available for exporting data until June. I chose not to wait.&#xA;I have been using Spotify happily for music for years now, so I decided to give it a try. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any research or look for other options. I had some confidence that it would be a reasonable option however because Spotify has been putting a lot of effort and money into its podcast offering.</description>
