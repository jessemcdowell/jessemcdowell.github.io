      <description>I recently launched my new company, Pragmatic Potato Software Inc. The creation of a company itself is pretty easy, but setting up everything you need to do business can become overwhelming quickly. There are a lot of compelling options available, each promising the moon. It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple though.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be writing about the technology stack I&amp;rsquo;m using to run my company, and why I made the choices I did.</description>

      <title>My Experience with the Dvorak Keyboard Layout</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been happily using the Dvorak keyboard layout for more than 25 years. I switched because I thought typing faster would be a benefit in my career. I can type faster, and it also reduces the strain on my wrists. It does have some drawbacks though. If you had asked me before writing this post I would have told you that I love it, but now I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure.</description>

      <title>Switching from Google Podcasts to Spotify</title>

      <description>Back in September Google announced that Google Podcasts will be shut down. It is supposed to remain available until April of 2024 and be available for exporting data until June. I chose not to wait.&#xA;I have been using Spotify happily for music for years now, so I decided to give it a try. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any research or look for other options. I had some confidence that it would be a reasonable option however because Spotify has been putting a lot of effort and money into its podcast offering.</description>

      <title>This Blog: Hexo-generated static site hosted on GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>A couple of years ago I switched this blog from a WordPress site hosted on GoDaddy to a statically generated site. The new setup is faster, more secure, and cheaper to operate. And it was easy to do!&#xA;Static vs Dynamic websites WordPress is a very popular blogging platform. You can use it hosted on WordPress.com, or any number of other web providers that offer it. Because it&amp;rsquo;s open source, you can also host it yourself easily.</description>

      <title>Review: Grammarly Premium</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-10-19-review-grammarly-premium/</link>

      <description>I spend a fair bit of time working on this blog. More than I probably should given my unimpressive view metrics. It does help me to crystalize my thoughts and practice articulating points that are important to me, but I&amp;rsquo;m spending an awful lot of time doing it. Ultimately, I write because I enjoy writing. I just wish I could spend less time per post.&#xA;For a while there I was getting hammered by ads from Grammarly, and in a fit of frustration, or maybe I was avoiding yet another hour of editing, I signed up.</description>
