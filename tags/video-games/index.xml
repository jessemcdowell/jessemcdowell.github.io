      <description>The most challenging bug I&amp;rsquo;ve ever fixed was a performance issue in a matchmaking routine. Matchmaking is the process of finding players to compete against each other in a video game. An excellent matchmaking algorithm doesn&amp;rsquo;t just stick players together randomly; it tries to make the game more fun by balancing power levels and preventing anyone from waiting too long for a match.&#xA;About six weeks before a game I was working on was scheduled to be feature complete, we discovered our routine couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle our load targets.</description>

      <description>There are many things about producing video games that are surprising, but one of the weirdest has to be the approach to bugs. Like any piece of software, bugs are found through testing or user reports, triaged, then assigned to developers. Unlike normal business software they also ask the question, &amp;ldquo;is the bug fun?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There are plenty of unintended features (bugs) in games that became beloved. Attack combos were an accident in Street Fighter II, but they became so popular that they are a part of basically every fighting game now.</description>
