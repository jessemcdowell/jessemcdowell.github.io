      <description>Making a program work for the happy path is not always easy, but given enough time I believe pretty much anyone could do it. When a professional takes on the task however they will make it work for more than just the happy path, and do it with code that is easy to debug, and easy for others to understand and change. Since so much of what we end up dealing with are exceptional flows, we need a concise way to deal with them.</description>

      <description>I had a frustrating issue at work this week: one that was easy to fix, but embarrassingly difficult to find. I came pretty close to giving up, which is not a solution I often explore, but in the end we figured it out and got everything working.&#xA;A member of our operations team was installing a Windows service I&amp;rsquo;d built to monitor some stuff in our production environment. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few windows services in my day, and installed them many times on many machines.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on the code that parses VCalendar data so that it can be processed. I&amp;rsquo;m copying the data I care about into a simple data structure that can represent a calendar request in any format. Any logic that interacts with calendar requests would use this internal structure. I want it to be simple, only having the stuff that I need, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to completely re-invent the wheel either, so I will use the VCalendar format as a guideline.</description>

      <title>64-bit IIS vs. 32-bit Assemblies</title>

      <description>I found my first 64-bit bug at work. I was moving a windows service built for the &amp;lsquo;Any CPU&amp;rsquo; to a 64-bit server. It started fine on the new server, and gave no indication of poor health in the logs, but one key function was malfunctioning. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what the cause is, but I know that the hash of any binary file was resulting in the same value. The service does some direct memory manipulation which is a likely culprit.</description>

      <description>My wife and I have been taking a Japanese class. I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it quite a bit, even though learning languages has never been easy for me. I need to work hard to memorize all the new words, and that means lots and lots of practice.&#xA;My wife bought a pack of index cards. This is what a normal person would do. To me, it seems like defeat. Why use paper when there&amp;rsquo;s a computer in the room?</description>
