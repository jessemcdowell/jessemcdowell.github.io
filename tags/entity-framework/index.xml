      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on the code that parses VCalendar data so that it can be processed. I&amp;rsquo;m copying the data I care about into a simple data structure that can represent a calendar request in any format. Any logic that interacts with calendar requests would use this internal structure. I want it to be simple, only having the stuff that I need, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to completely re-invent the wheel either, so I will use the VCalendar format as a guideline.</description>

      <description>My wife and I have been taking a Japanese class. I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it quite a bit, even though learning languages has never been easy for me. I need to work hard to memorize all the new words, and that means lots and lots of practice.&#xA;My wife bought a pack of index cards. This is what a normal person would do. To me, it seems like defeat. Why use paper when there&amp;rsquo;s a computer in the room?</description>
