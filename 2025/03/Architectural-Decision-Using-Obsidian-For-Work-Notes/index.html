<p>I have been feeling frustrated with my personal organization of late. I had a bit of time before starting a new project, so I put some time into improving my process. The post below is a simplified version of the notes I took while I looked for alternatives. I’m sharing this as an example of how I do research, and as a more realistic example of <a href="/resources/architectural-report-template/">the architectural report structure I typically use</a>, which <a href="/2023/11/Using-Architectural-Decision-Records/">I’ve written about before</a>.</p>
<p>According to my records, I spent 28 hours working on the decision. This breaks down to about 22 hours testing the eight finalists, 4 hours researching options, at a summary level, and 2 hours of planning. Of the time spent testing, I spent between 30 and 240 minutes each for 7 of the 8 finalists. I spent 8 hours testing Obsidian, though most of that was testing and improving the processes I ended up using.</p>
<p>I started this task thinking purely about about improving my working notes and personal task list, but as I dug further in, it became apparent that I could centralize many of the different organizational tools I use. That process is still under way as of this writing, but I must say, it feels pretty nice every time I delete another productivity app.</p>
<h2 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h2><p>This document is a decision record explaining my choice for replacing my organizational system. Theoretically, it is intended for myself as a way to guide my thinking, but in reality, I am only writing it out in this form to share on my blog. The real document I used as the first draft for this post is similar, but a lot rougher, and with other unimportant details jumbled in.</p>
<p><em>Some of this text is inserted purely as commentary for the blog post, and would not normally be included in a decision record document. I have marked such text with italics, this paragraph included.</em></p>
<h2 id="Context"><a href="#Context" class="headerlink" title="Context"></a>Context</h2><ul>
<li>My personal backlog is spread across two email accounts, Trello, Remember The Milk, a few Evernote notes, and occasionally project management systems used by my customers. I would like to have one place where I can see all of my priorities so that I can easily find the next most important thing to work on, and to ensure important tasks don’t get dropped.</li>
<li>I am spending a fair bit of time fiddling with cards in Trello, trying to update them, reset them, and change the dates on them. I don’t feel like I ever have a good view of my priorities there. I am also worried that important tasks are getting dropped because of it’s limitations.</li>
<li>Remember The Milk is great for managing recurring tasks, but it doesn’t work for anything more complicated than simple chores. Some of my projects have a lot of research notes, open questions, and subtasks that are best kept all together. Trello can handle more complexity in a card, but I still find it limiting for a project that is more than a couple days of work.</li>
<li>Keeping a backlog spread between notes in Evernote and Trello lists causes unnecessary work reconciling the two. I also end up searching both when I want to find notes from something I’ve done in the past.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Decision"><a href="#Decision" class="headerlink" title="Decision"></a>Decision</h2><ul>
<li>Try using Obsidian<ul>
<li>Use a minimal number of vaults</li>
<li>Set up the Tasks plugin</li>
<li>Create a daily note template that includes incomplete tasks scheduled for that day and a view of my calendar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Migrate one type of information at a time. Migrate new types as I get more accustomed to Obsidian.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Options-Evaluated"><a href="#Options-Evaluated" class="headerlink" title="Options Evaluated"></a>Options Evaluated</h2><h3 id="Finalists"><a href="#Finalists" class="headerlink" title="Finalists"></a>Finalists</h3><p>I tested each of these applications before choosing Obsidian.</p>
<p><em>The table below is what I call a decision matrix. I put options across the top, and questions down the side. I don’t particularly like tables for this sort of data, but so far, they’re the best solution I’ve found. A nice feature of this format is that I can keep expanding the list of questions as I learn more about the available options and the problem I’m trying to solve.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t go out of my way to answer every question for every option. When an option stacks up enough limitations or blockers, or I just have a feeling that it’s not what I’m looking for, I focus my attention on something else. The tabular format makes it easy to see when I’ve done this, but also makes it possible to pick up where I left off if all the other options prove to be worse.</em></p>
<p><em>I like to use background shading in the cells (green, yellow, and red) to mark answers that are notable strengths, weaknesses, or blockers. For the sake of this blog post, I’ve added emoji to the cells instead.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amplenote</strong> - included in matrix above</li>
<li><strong>Affine.pro</strong> - disqualified pretty quickly because there was no mobile option and had a very small library of plugins</li>
