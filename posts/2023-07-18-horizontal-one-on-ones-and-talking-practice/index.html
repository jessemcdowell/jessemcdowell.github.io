        <p>When I was promoted to the role of architect it was a new role in the organization. The stakeholders I had to work with were not used to talking to an architect, and weren&rsquo;t sure what I did or when I should be involved in a conversation. I started using recurring one-on-one meetings with each stakeholder separately. It worked great. It&rsquo;s also made me a much better communicator.</p>
<p>One of the first and most important lessons I learned as an architect is that you can&rsquo;t design a good architecture without a good understanding of its requirements. You can design a system in a vacuum, it&rsquo;s also much easier to do it this way, but it&rsquo;s far less likely to serve the organization. Gathering, validating, and documenting technical requirements is tough work, but an essential part of being an architect.</p>
<p>The best way to discover needs and requirements is to talk to people who know them. There is quite a lot of ways to approach this, and a lot has been written on this subject. For me, I knew I needed to chat with my stakeholders early and often, and private meetings was the simplest technique that could possibly work.</p>
<p>In my first one-on-one meetings I explained my role, and more importantly, why my role would be beneficial to each of them. For the product manager I explained that if I was good at my job I would help the development team go faster (because of less rework) and to reduce the technical risks of higher value projects before they were scheduled. For the product owner and development leads I explained that I would find and encourage new technologies that helped the team go faster, and help to keep projects moving smoothly.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any difficulty getting time on a regular schedule. Even with a 3-month release cycle, there was always enough to fill a meeting every two weeks with each of my main stakeholders. I always came prepared with questions, and after a while my stakeholders starting bringing questions for me too.</p>
<p>I think I have pretty good communication skills, but when you need to explain the value of technical work to people who are primarily non-technical it can be a lot more difficult. It&rsquo;s even more daunting because the people I was meeting with were far, far better presenters and public speakers than I am.</p>
<p>I started noticing that I was getting very similar questions from different stakeholders, and so I was able to re-use my answers. And with time, I started getting better at it. Regular conversations certainly helped, but talking about the same topics over and over seemed to make an even bigger difference. Every time I answered a similar question I had a chance to refine my best points and try out new ones.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to work in an environment with a lot of trust: I could speak my mind honestly, and I didn&rsquo;t really need to be persuasive to make sure my ideas were heard. Even still, the better I got, the more confident I felt. Portraying confidence is important in a leadership position - if a leader looks worried it can generate more stress for those around them.</p>
<p>After a few years of these meetings, I am convinced that they were a big part of my success as an architect. I&rsquo;m also convinced that they&rsquo;ve helped me improve as a communicator.</p>
<p>Repeating similar conversation has been so valuable, that I&rsquo;ve started having practice conversations just for the sake of it. Rough notes and research is still my preferred place to start, but this type of preparation starts to have diminishing returns after a while. If I really need to nail a conversation, a practice conversation is an efficient way to improve my messages. All it takes is a bit of time from a trusted colleague, or if that&rsquo;s not possible, a rubber duck can do the job too.</p>
