      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a big step in my career. I&amp;rsquo;ve become a software consultant.&#xA;The decision to leave my job of three and a half years wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy one. I was working with some fantastic people, building the best software we could, but at the end of the day I wasn&amp;rsquo;t learning. The work was challenging, but the challenges were mostly non-technical. In this business, if you&amp;rsquo;re not moving forward you may as well lay down and die.</description>
